🚀 Exciting Project: Bulk Mail Sending App with React & Nodemailer 🚀
I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on: Bulk Mail Sending App! 🎉
This app allows users to easily upload an Excel file 📂 containing email addresses and send personalized messages to multiple recipients at once. No more manually sending emails one by one!
🛠️ Tech Stack:
•	Frontend: React, CSS,Axios, XLSX (for Excel file parsing)
•	Backend: Node.js, Express, Nodemailer (for sending emails)
•	Email Service: SMTP (e.g., Gmail or yahoo)
🧩 How it Works:
1.	Upload an Excel file with email addresses 📥
2.	Enter your email message ✉️
3.	Click Send – the app will automatically send your message to all the email addresses from the file 🔥
This project was a great learning experience in integrating front-end and back-end technologies to automate bulk communication, making it perfect for businesses and marketers.
🔧 Features:
•	Easy file upload and parsing of email data
•	Seamless integration between front-end and back-end
•	Fast and secure email sending with Nodemailer
It was fun working with React for the front-end and Node.js + Nodemailer for email dispatch, and I can’t wait to build on this idea with more features like email scheduling and analytics. 📈
